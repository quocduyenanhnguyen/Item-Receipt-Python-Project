In this project, I created a list of baby products under three categories (Bath and Skin Care, Food and Formula, Feeding and Nursing) and I wrote Python codes to ask users to select a product then pay for it (i.e. a simple item receipt) by developing multiple Python functions (to ask user to select item from the three categories, and a closing function to ask users to pay). Before running the codes, I put the AppJar folder and Python codes in the same folder. 

Here's the link where you can find the AppJar folder that I used to run Python codes: http://appjar.info/Install/.
