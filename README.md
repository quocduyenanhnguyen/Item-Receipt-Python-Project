In this project, I created a list of baby products under three categories (Bath and Skin Care, Food and Formula, Feeding and Nursing) and I wrote Python codes to ask users to select a product then pay for it (i.e. a simple item receipt) by developing multiple Python functions (to ask user to select item from the three categories, and a closing function to ask users to pay).
