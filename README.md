# Software I used: 
[Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org)

# Description: 
- In this project, I created a list of baby products under three categories (Bath and Skin Care, Food and Formula, Feeding and Nursing) and I wrote Python codes to ask users to select a product then pay for it (i.e. a simple item receipt) by developing multiple Python functions (to ask user to select item from the three categories, and a closing function to ask users to pay). Before running the codes, I put the [AppJar folder](http://appjar.info/Install/), Python codes, GIF image, and babystore.csv file in the same folder for the codes to run.
